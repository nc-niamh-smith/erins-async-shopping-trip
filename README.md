#Â Erin's Shopping Trip

-My little sister has a task to do: the grocery shop.

There are a few things that she has to do in order to complete this shopping trip.

1. She'll have to cash a cheque, so that we have money in the bank account. (Tests and code have been written in the promises or async-await file, please have a look at them).

2. Then, she will have to goToTheShop - a util function has been provided that will complete that - but we need to add it to erinsGroceryShop. (Tests have been written).

3. Finally, she gets there, and realises that she hasn't actually written a shopping list. Before the shop, she must write a list. (Tests are written).


Advanced challenges:

-Convert your promises solution into a Promise.all()
-Convert your promises solution into async/await syntax

Even more advanced challenge:

-Convert your solution into callbacks
